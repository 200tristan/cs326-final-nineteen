Inovative Idea:
Our chat app is an alternative take on messaging by instead focusing on creativity, 
the app will feature minimalist design with a intergrated social aspect. Users will be able to express themselves uniquely using simplified drawing tools and advanced social features.   

Important Components:
Multiple components will work in tandem to make the service function. There will be a drawing component that allows the user to draw and save the canvas as a jpeg, a simple viewing component that will allow fullscreen viewing, a feed component to showcase user artwork, aswell as social features to like and remix exsisting posts.

# Innovative Idea
ScribbleGram is a revolutionary new way for users to express themselves through handcrafted art. Traditional social media apps restrict the user's creativity by forcing them to form thoughts and ideas solely using words; our app aims to change that. We strive to let our users reach their full creative potential. By following the design characteristics laid by industry innovators such as Apple, we have built a GUI focusing on minimalism and accessibility. Users will be able to like, share, create and remix drawings on a public mainboard.
